# Error Handling in JavaScript

This is a beginner-level JavaScript project demonstrating **error handling** using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, along with `throw` and user input validation using `prompt()`.

## Features

* Prompts user to enter two numbers.
* Validates that both inputs are numeric.
* Throws a `SyntaxError` if non-numeric input is detected.
* Calculates and logs the sum of the two numbers.
* Uses a `try...catch...finally` block to handle and log errors.
* Demonstrates the use of `finally` block which always executes.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter two numbers when prompted.

## Example Behavior

```bash
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
The sum of numbers is 15
I am finally, I will run at any cause!
true
```

## Learning Points

* Input validation using `isNaN()`
* Throwing custom errors
* Try/Catch/Finally usage
* Graceful error handling
